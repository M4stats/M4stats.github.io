## Academic articles {#papers}

We have also published more than 125 scientific papers in internationally recognized academic journals. In nearly all of these publications, we make use of complex statistical analyses and visualization techniques to increase the knowledge base within different research topics ranging from health-research over neurosience to environmental psychology and tourism research. We have also contributed to the development of these tools as reflected in a number of publications dedicated to method development.
